The contents of this Repository show the first iteration of The Box Co. website, put together for 4560. I originally coded this in .html and then moved to .php for a more dynamic feel. This was ultimately moved to infinityFree. Also contained within are the the screenshots documenting the user functionality provided by the site, and vulnerability scans detailing the security currently provided.
